# PortSwigger Web Security Academy Write-ups

This directory contains my personal write-ups for the labs on the [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security).

These write-ups serve two main purposes:

* **Progress Tracking:** They act as a record of my progress through the academy's learning path.
* **Personal Notes:** They are a quick-reference guide for myself, summarizing key concepts, exploit methods, and payloads for future use.
