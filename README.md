# CTF Write-ups

This repository serves as a personal collection of write-ups for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and security labs I've solved. Its primary purpose is to document my learning journey, solidify my understanding of various cybersecurity concepts, and showcase my practical problem-solving abilities.

I am actively building this portfolio to demonstrate my hands-on experience as I progress in the cybersecurity field.

## Repository Content

This repository contains detailed walkthroughs for various security challenges, including:

* **Web Exploitation:** Solutions for challenges involving common web application vulnerabilities.
* **Other Challenge Types:** As my learning progresses, I will include write-ups for other types of security challenges.

Each write-up provides a step-by-step solution, including the challenge's context, tools used, my thought process, and key lessons learned.

## Repository Structure

The write-ups are organized first by the CTF event or learning platform, and then by the specific type of challenge.
