# 🔐 CTF Write-ups & Web Security Labs

Welcome to my collection of **CTF write-ups** and **security lab solutions**.  
This repo is my personal knowledge base - documenting the challenges I've solved,  
breaking down my thought process, and reflecting on what I’ve learned along the way.  

💡 The focus is **Web Exploitation**.
